# Miniature Handheld Console

This repository tracks the most recent state of my miniature handheld console project. It currently supports two games, a version of pong and brick breaker.

It's a mess and unpolished. For a more in depth look at the project and it's history see [my website](https://www.williamfheuer.com/project-portfolio).
